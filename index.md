### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorite projects I did because it was 
    really interesting learning about how gifs and images really are made.
    I was able to write functions and code that were able to create images
    and gifs that were animated. It is really interesting learning about how
    everything we see on our computers and our phones are being made with
    these codes.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was also one of my favorite projects I did because although
    it is a simple code, it can be extremely useful on a daily basis. I also
    learned about the .push_back() function and for-loops that are used multiple times in
    coding. I find simple functions like these are the most interesting because they can be
    utilized in more complicated codes and make them easier to understand.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was really interesting to me because of how equations can actually be 
    solved by coding. By creating a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle,
    it becomes extremely easy to figure out no matter what kind of numbers you are working
    with. I also find it interesting that it does not matter how big of numbers you are using,
    but it will calculate any large number you input.
